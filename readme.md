###NightWriter

My learning goals for this project are to:
* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Testing components in isolation and in combination
* Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context
* Reading text from and writing text to files

####Breaking the project down:
First I will translate a plaintext file to Braille. Then I'll convert it back to Braille using a two-by-three grid of 0 and dots.

####Testing components in isolation and in combination
I'll do my best to do test-driven-development.

####Applying Enumerable techniques
I anticipate using enums to iterate through the messages and convert them.

####Reading text from and writing text to files
I will use FILE I/O class and commands to read and write Braille and plaintext and add converted text to files.
